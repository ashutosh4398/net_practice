# Validate subsequence
Given two non-empty array of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is subsequence of the first one
<br/>
A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array
Eg: <code>[1,3,4]</code> form a subsequence of the array <code>[1,2,3,4]</code> and so do the numbers <code>[2,4]</code>
